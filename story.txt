Little red riding hood told her mom she was going to visit her grandmother. Her mother gave her permission, so little red riding hood got her things and her basket and set out for the forest. Along the way she met a cute doggo that wanted on of her muffins. Because the doggo was so cute, little red riding hood gave him two muffins. They arrived at her grandmothers house and enjoyed some bonding time with their new pet doggo, which she name "wolfie".
