Little red riding hood asked her mom if she could go visit her grandmother. Her mother gave her permission, so little red riding hood got her things and her basket. She filled the basket with muffins and a pie. Along the way she met a cute, red doggo that wanted one of her muffins. Because the doggo was so cute, little red riding hood gave him two muffins. They arrived at her grandmothers house and enjoyed some bonding time with their new pet doggo, which she name "muffin".
